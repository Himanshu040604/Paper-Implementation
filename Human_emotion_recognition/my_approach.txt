my system is not a simple eeg classifier. i built a full end-to-end neuro-vision transformer that turns raw brain 
signals into spatial images and then into emotional understanding. this is a new generation architecture that goes far beyond the 
classical pipeline used in the AMIGOS paper.

brain-computer interface architecture:
1. raw EEG to time-frequency decomposition:

- input: 14 electrodes, 128 Hz sampling rate

- segmentation: signals are segmented into overlapping 2s windows

- transform: applied discrete wavelet transform (DWT) using db4 to split signal into 5 bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma)

- energy: computed band energy for each channel to create a 14x5 tensor. this replaces handcrafted features with physiological spectral energy.

2. neuro-frequency to brain topography:

- instead of treating EEG as vectors, i converted it into images

- used the 10-20 electrode coordinates to perform continuous spatial interpolation

- this creates a 32x32 spatial map for each of the 5 frequency bands (final shape: 5x32x32). 
this makes the EEG behave like multi-spectral satellite imagery.

3. CNN + DCAB (local neuro-spatial attention):

- fed the EEG images into convolutional layers to learn spatial and frequency interactions

- added dual channel-spatial attention block (DCAB):

- channel attention: learns which frequency bands matter

- spatial attention: learns which brain regions matter

4. DPUMB (multi-scale patterns):

- added depthwise parallel multi-kernel blocks using kernel sizes 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7

- this detects local activations, medium-range interactions, and global brain patterns simultaneously

- outputs are fused using pointwise convolution and residual connections.

5. transformer-style attention pooling:

- patch embedding: split the EEG topomap into patches to form tokens

- self-attention: added a class token and ran multi-head attention to learn global dependencies

- this allows the model to figure out which brain regions and frequencies explain the emotion (similar to how vision transformers analyze images).

6. emotion heads:

- outputs: valence (positive vs negative) and arousal (calm vs excited)

- loss function: BCEWithLogitsLoss for simultaneous binary classification

comparison with AMIGOS paper:
- paper used handcrafted features -> i used learned wavelet features
- paper had no spatial modeling -> i used full scalp topology
- paper used random forest -> i used CNN + attention
- paper had no global reasoning -> i used transformer pooling

what i created: i didn't just implement the paper. i created a next-generation EEG emotion AI that "sees" brain waves 
and understands brain geography. this architecture is capable of reasoning over brain states and is suitable for BCI, 
mental health AI, and cognitive neuroscience.
